# Prediction of Classes from the CIFAR10 Dataset
Implemented a 8 layer convolution neural network and trained the network with a dropout probability of 20%. Used RandomCrop() and RandomHorizontalFlip() as the data augmentation techniques and trained the model over 200 epochs using ADAM Optimizer

## Test Accuracy
Achieved a test accuracy of about 82%
