# Built a Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch
Implemented a single layer convolution neural network using a 3x3 filter with 3 channels. Used a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) for activation. Trained the model over 10 epochs using Stochastic Gradient Decent and Backward Propagation Algorithm on the *MNIST* Dataset
